# Turn-Based_Queue_Project
A test project to develop the combat mechanics for a turn-queue based combat rpg.

## What is the scope of the project?
For now, I aim to develop the general mechanics surrounding a turn-queue based battle adventure rpg, with more emphasis on developing the combat aspect.

## How can progress be tracked?
I am attempting to have cards concerning current progress posted in the projects tab in the only project currently there.
